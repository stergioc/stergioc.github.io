Recent spatial profiling methods are transforming molecular biology by providing high-resolution insights into gene expression or protein abundance within the spatial context of tissues. Within this research axis we develop computational methods to uncover the relationships between spatially resolved phenotypical, morphological and molecular information towards biomarker discovery. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, we aim to enhance our understanding of complex biological systems and disease mechanisms.
