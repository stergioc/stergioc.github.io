More often than not, medical applications require that the employed images are on the same coordinate system, making the registration process a necessary prerequisite. On this research axis we are focusing on how to utilize learning based registration methods on medical data across diferent patients as well as across time. We proposed a number of methods for registration of both CT scans as well as MRI scans accross different tissue times. These methods have also been extended to sattelite images and have been used to quantify changes.
