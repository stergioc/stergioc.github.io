Computational Pathology has revolutionized histopathological analysis by leveraging sophisticated computational techniques to augment clinical workflows. Our team is implicated in multiple projects aiming to develop novel methods for processing gigapixel sized digital pathology slides for variety of cancer types. Within this framework we have proposed a number of self-supervised tasks for cell/nuclei segmentation, stain tranfer or WSI-level prediction endpoints.
