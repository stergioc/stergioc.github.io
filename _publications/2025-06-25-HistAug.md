**Abstract:** Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.
