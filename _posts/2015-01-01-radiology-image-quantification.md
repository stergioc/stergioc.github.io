Radiological images provide a non invasive way to study different diseases. Providing automatic tools for the quantification of radiology markers or characteristics can help on different clinically relevant endoinds such as screening, diagnosis or even prognosis assisting radiologists during their clinical practice. Within this reseeach axes we have proposed a number of deep learning models for the detection and quantification of lung pneumonias from CT scans.
