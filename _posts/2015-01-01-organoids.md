In collaboration with [Gustave Roussy](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en){:target="_blank"} and [Jaulin Lab](https://jaulinlab.com/){:target="_blank"} as well as other partners we are participating in the [RHU Organomic project](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/fr/rhu-organomic-des-organoides-prediction-traitements-cancers-digestifs){:target="_blank"}, on developing novel imaging-based high-throughput screening method to assess real-time drug efficacy from a time-lapse microscopy video of patient-derived organoids (PDO).
