**Abstract:** The mechanisms of action of and resistance to trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), an anti-HER2–drug conjugate for breast cancer treatment, remain unclear. The phase 2 DAISY trial evaluated the efficacy of T-DXd in patients with HER2-overexpressing (n = 72, cohort 1), HER2-low (n = 74, cohort 2) and HER2 non-expressing (n = 40, cohort 3) metastatic breast cancer. In the full analysis set population (n = 177), the confirmed objective response rate (primary endpoint) was 70.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 58.3–81) in cohort 1, 37.5% (95% CI 26.4–49.7) in cohort 2 and 29.7% (95% CI 15.9–47) in cohort 3. The primary endpoint was met in cohorts 1 and 2. Secondary endpoints included safety. No new safety signals were observed. During treatment, HER2-expressing tumors (n = 4) presented strong T-DXd staining. Conversely, HER2 immunohistochemistry 0 samples (n = 3) presented no or very few T-DXd staining (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.75, P = 0.053). Among patients with HER2 immunohistochemistry 0 metastatic breast cancer, 5 of 14 (35.7%, 95% CI 12.8–64.9) with ERBB2 expression below the median presented a confirmed objective response as compared to 3 of 10 (30%, 95% CI 6.7–65.2) with ERBB2 expression above the median. Although HER2 expression is a determinant of T-DXd efficacy, our study suggests that additional mechanisms may also be involved. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04132960.)
