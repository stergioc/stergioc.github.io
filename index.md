I received a diploma in electrical and computer engineering at the Polytechnic School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Soon after, I joined the graduate school of the University of Bern, where I conducted my PhD at the <a href="https://www.artorg.unibe.ch/" target="_blank">ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering Research</a> under the supervisison of Prof. Stavroula Mougiakakou. There, I focused on the design of computer-assisted diagnosis support systems for interstitial lung diseases using deep learning approaches. As a part of a doctoral mobility collaboration, Ι worked with Prof. Nikos Paragios on deep learning-based medical image registration pipelines at the <a href="http://cvn.centralesupelec.fr/" target="_blank">Central Vision Numeric (CVN)</a> of CentraleSupélec in Paris. I continued my research on computer-assisted approaches for healthcare as a fellow of the <a href="http://p3.snf.ch/project-188153" target="_blank">SNSF Early Postdoc Mobility grant</a> at Gustave Roussy in Paris. Ι worked on computer-assisted precision medicine for breast cancer in collaboration with Prof. Fabrice Andre, Prof. Eric Deutsch, Prof. Laurence Zitvogel, Prof. Nikos Paragios and Prof. Maria Vakalopoulou as part of the <a href="https://prism.center/" target="_blank">Centre National de Médecine de Précision (PRISM)</a>.
